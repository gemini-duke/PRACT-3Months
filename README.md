# "Effectiveness of a Brief Negotiational Intervention and Text-Based Booster to Reduce Harmful and Hazardous Alcohol Use in the Emergency Department of a Low-Resource Setting: A Pragmatic Randomized Adaptive Clinical Trial in Moshi, Tanzania"

## Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally adapted intervention, "Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako/Reduce Alcohol for your Health", which is supplemented by mobile health-based text message boosters, in reducing harmful and hazardous alcohol use among adult acute injury patients in Moshi, Tanzania.

## Abstract
Background:
Alcohol use contributes to over 3 million deaths annually. In Tanzania, similar to other low- and middle-income countries, there are no evidence-based culturally adapted interventions to address harmful alcohol use behaviors. We aim to determine the effectiveness of a culturally adapted brief intervention, “Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako/Reduce Alcohol for your Health”, with mobile health-based boosters in reducing alcohol use and consequences at 3 months after discharge for adult acute injury patients presenting for care.
Methods:
We are conducting a pragmatic adaptive randomized control trial with two distinct stages, of which we are reporting only Stage 1. Stage 1 is a superiority trial comparing a culturally adapted brief intervention with short-message-service (SMS) text boosters versus usual care. Participants eligible for enrollment are adult injury patients (≥18 years of age), who sought care for an acute injury (<24 hours) at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre Emergency Department. Alcohol-related criteria for inclusion comprise self-disclosed alcohol use prior to the injury, scoring ≥8 on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), and/or testing positive (>0.0 g/dL) by alcohol breathalyzer. For all stages, the primary outcome was the number of binge drinking days in the previous 4 weeks.
Results:
During the trial period, 448 patients met inclusion criteria and consented to participate in the study. Of these, 148 were randomized to usual care, and 300 were randomized to the intervention arms. At the 3-month follow-up, significant differences were observed between the intervention arm and the usual care group. In the primary outcome, the intervention arm showed a notable reduction in mean predicted binge drinking days by 2.03 days (95% CI: -3.53 to -0.86; p=0.0035). Additionally, significant reductions were seen in secondary outcomes for the intervention group: the mean predicted number of drinking days (reduction of 1 day; 95% CI: -2.71 to 0.82; p=0.0005), and the predicted mean difference in the number of drinks (-12.22 drinks; 95% CI: -29.5 to 3.32; p=0.0024). However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of drinking-related consequences or depression.
Discussion:
When compared to the usual care arm, Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako with text booster significantly reduces binge drinking days, binge drinking episodes, and mean number of drinks consumed. These reductions in alcohol use at 3-month follow-up suggest our culturally adapted intervention is effective for alcohol harm reduction in acute injury patients in Tanzania.
