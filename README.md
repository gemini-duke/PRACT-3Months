## Abstract
**Background**: Alcohol use contributes to over 3 million deaths annually. In Tanzania, there are no evidence-based culturally adapted interventions to address harmful alcohol use behaviors. We report the results of a superiority clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of a culturally adapted brief intervention, “Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako” (PPKAY, Reduce Alcohol for your Health), with text-based boosters to usual care. 
**Methods and Findings**: This manuscript will report Stage 1 of our adaptive clinical trial which seeks to determine the effectiveness of the PPKAY + booster to usual care; a subsequent stage will compare the PPKAY only to personalized and standard boosters. Adults who sought care for an acute injury at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre Emergency Department, self-disclosed alcohol use prior to the injury, scored ≥8 on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, and/or test positive by alcohol breathalyzer were offered enrollment. Participants were randomly assigned to PPKAY + boosters (personalized or standard) or usual care at 1:1:1 allocation. The PPKAY is a 15 minute nurse delivered brief intervention using motivational interviewing techniques combined with a standardized or personalized text based reminder sent weekly to participants after hospital discharge and until 1 year post enrollment compared to a usual care arm. Follow-up was performed by blinded outcome assessors. Our pooled intervention arms PPKAY+ boosters were compared to usual care to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the number of binge drinking days in the previous 4 weeks at 3 months after discharge. 
Of 1484 patients screened for eligibility, 448 patients met inclusion criteria and consented to participate. 148 were randomized to usual care, and 300 to the pooled intervention arm. During the study period, 4 patient deaths occurred, which are considered unrelated to the intervention. At the 3-month follow-up, the intervention arm showed a notable reduction in mean predicted binge drinking days by 1.2 days (95% CI: -2.3, -0.3; p=0.00234) compared to the usual care group in a difference-in-differences analysis. The intervention group reported fewer drinking days and a lower number of drinks at 3 months compared to usual care. No meaningful differences were observed between groups in drinking-related consequences or depression. 
**Interpretation**: The reduction in binge drinking behavior, mean drinking days and number of drinks at 3-month follow-up compared to usual care suggests our culturally adapted intervention is an effective alcohol intervention for acute injury patients in Tanzania. Importantly, the self-reported nature of our primary outcome introduces the potential for social desirability bias, particularly in the absence of participant blinding, and should be considered a limitation when interpreting the findings.
